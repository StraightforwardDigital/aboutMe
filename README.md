Projects to refine my coding skills

I started my career like most, not knowing what I wanted to do but needing to pay my bills. I ended up working in insurance for years before realising there was another option.

As my disatisfaction with my job grew, so did my curiosity around technology. I ended up building my own computer from cheap parts and YouTube tutorials. I was hooked.

I enrolled in an web development course online. I learned to build drag-and-drop websites without coding. After building a few sites this way, I decided if I was serious about web development, I needed to have the coding chops to back it up.

That’s when I began coding websites from scratch. I'm now on a journey to develop my coding skills and finding worth while applicaitons to apply them.
